AUTHENTICATION->WHO I AM
AUTHORIZATION->WHAT I AM ALLOWED TO DO

TO SECURE APPLICATION FROM UNAUTHORIZED THIRD PARTY FIRST THING THAT CAME UP WAS USERID AND PASSWORD
BUT THE PROBLEN WITH THIS  WAS 
1.IF SOMEHOW PASSWORD GET LEAK THAN IT CAN BE RISKY
2.OTHER PROBLEM EVEN IF THE USER IS VALID AND ACCESSING THE WEB AT EACH CALL PASSWORD AND USERNAME TRAVEL ACROOS THE NETWORK CALLS WHICH IS VERY RISKY


THEN CAME TOKEN BASED SYSTEM
NOW AFTER LOGIN ACCESS TOKEN IS BEING PROVIDED WHICH TTL(MEANS YOU CAN DECIDE ITS DURATION OF AVAILABILITY)
NOW IN THIS AT EACH INSTEAD OF YOUR PASSWORD ACCESSTOKEN IS BEING VERIFIED AND YOU HAVE SEND YOUR PASSWORD OVER THE NETWORK ONLY ONE TIME



IN NOWADAYS IT HAS BECOME TO HECTIC TO ASK FOR SOMEONE TO REGISTER TO YOUR APP PUTTING EACH DETAIL THEN THERE IS SECURITY RISK SO PEOPLE AVOID 
SO IN ORDER TO OVERCOME OAUTH HAS BEEN USED WHERE APP USE THIRD PARTY WHICH IS ALREADY BEING TRUSTED BY USER(EG. GOOGLE FACEBOOK) KEEPING THE PRIVACY AND ONLY TAKING NECESSARY DETAILS.
